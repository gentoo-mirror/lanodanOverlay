Adding this overlay: layman -a lanodanOverlay

# What’s in here
• ebuilds removed from ::gentoo
• ebuilds different from ::gentoo (See notes compared to ::gentoo)
• ebuilds not yet present in ::gentoo

# Goals
• More compatibility with my systems choices (LLVM, LibreSSL, musl, Hardened, …)
• More security
• Gentoo on my smartphone(s)
• More choices, alternatives, …
• Long-term goals:
	• being able to remove bash (using a shim?)
	• UID 0 ≠ root compatibility

# Recipes notes compared to ::gentoo:

## app-editors/vis
• Note: I proxy-maintain ::gentoo one too, so this one is experimental
• Added dependencies on dev-lang/lua-5.2

## media-gfx/krita
• Changed dependencies (Used the CMakeList.txt file to get required and optionnals)
• Added USE flags: threads curl zlib
