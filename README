Adding this overlay: layman -a lanodanOverlay

# What’s in here
• ebuilds removed from ::gentoo
• ebuilds different from ::gentoo (See notes compared to ::gentoo)
• ebuilds not yet present in ::gentoo

# Goals
• More compatibility with my systems choices (LLVM, LibreSSL, musl, Hardened, …)
• More security
• Gentoo on my smartphone(s)
• More choices, alternatives, …
• Long-term goals:
	• being able to remove bash (using a shim?)
	• UID 0 ≠ root compatibility
	• Reproductibility (see Debian Projects)

• Added dependencies on dev-lang/lua-5.2

## media-gfx/krita

• Added USE flags: threads curl zlib

## app-misc/kanatest
• Bumped from EAPI 5 to EAPI 6
• Add patch removing __DATE__ __TIME__

## media-libs/libsidplay:2
