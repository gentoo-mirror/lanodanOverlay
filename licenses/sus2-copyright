	 2.  Right of Use

	     The Licensee shall	have the right to use the Works
	     contained on the CD-ROM for any purpose, subject to
	     the limitations of	these Terms and	Conditions on Re-
	     publication.  Furthermore,	the Licensee shall have	the
	     right:

	       a.  to store and	have the CD-ROM	stored in
		   electronic form on one computer at a	time,
		   subject to the waiver set out in Clause 4;

	       b.  to display the contents of the CD-ROM on a
		   computer screen; and

	       c.  for the Licensee's internal use only, to produce
		   paper copies	of limited parts of any	Work, as
		   provided within the functionality of	the
		   software.

	     For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in these Terms	and
	     Conditions	shall entitle the Licensee to use the Work
	     in	any way	other than for the Licensee's own internal
	     business purposes,	nor to disclose	the Work to any
	     third party.

	     Where any Work is subject to the copyright	of any
	     person other than The Open	Group (``a joint
	     publication'') the	rights set out here are	subject	to
	     any further conditions or limitations prescribed in
	     respect of	that Work (as set out therein) in order	to
	     protect the rights	of that	other copyright	owner.

	     Where more	than one CD-ROM	is supplied under this
	     Agreement,	these rights shall apply separately in
	     respect of	each CD-ROM.

	 3.  Restrictions in Liability

	     THE OPEN GROUP ACCEPTS LIABILITY UP TO A LIMIT EQUAL TO THE
	     PRICE PAID	FOR THE	CD-ROM.	 THERE SHALL BE	NO LIMIT TO
	     ANY LEGAL LIABILITY FOR ANY DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY.

	 4.  Use of html files

	     Files ending in the extension .htm or .html are intended for
	     viewing by	intranet browser software. Implicit in this
	     method of browsing	is the concept that the	files may
	     be	viewed simultaneously by users on remote computers
	     or	consoles.  It is permitted that	the .htm/.html files on
	     the CD-ROM	be simultaneously accessed by two or more
	     computers or consoles at any given	time, provided that
	     the users of those	computers or consoles are employees
	     of	the Licensee.

	     The Licensee shall	not be permitted to distribute the
	     CD-ROM .htm/.html files (or any other files on the CD-ROM)
	     onto the Internet without prior written permission	of
	     The Open Group.

	 5.  Re-publication

	     Save as set out above or as separately agreed, the
	     Licensee shall have no right to Re-publish	or
	     distribute	the CD-ROM or its contents in any way or on
	     any medium	whatever.

	 6.  Termination

	     Either party may by written notice	forthwith terminate
	     this Agreement if the other party commits any material
	     breach of these Terms and Conditions and fails to
	     remedy it within a	reasonable period after	receiving
	     written notice from the other party; the other party
	     suffers distress or execution, commits an act of
	     bankruptcy, goes or is put	into liquidation (otherwise
	     than solely for the purpose of solvent amalgamation or
	     reconstruction), or seeks any form	of protection
	     against its creditors from	any competent Court or
	     Tribunal; or a receiver or	administrative receiver	is
	     appointed over any	substantial part of the	other
	     party's business.

	     Upon termination under this Clause	or otherwise, the
	     Licensee shall within one month deliver up	any
	     materials or equipment, including any special computer
	     programs or electronic media supplied by The Open
	     Group and shall certify that all copies (in electronic
	     or	other form) derived from the CD-ROM have been
	     destroyed.

	     Termination of this Agreement (however occurring)
	     shall not affect any accrued rights or liabilities	of
	     either party nor shall it affect the coming into force
	     or	the continuance	in force of any	provision which	is
	     expressly or by implication intended to come into or
	     continue in force on or after such	termination.

	 7.  Disputes

	     These Terms and Conditions	shall be construed in
	     accordance	with the law of	England	and Wales.  Any
	     dispute arising under or in connection with these
	     Terms and Conditions shall	be referred to arbitration
	     before a sole arbitrator to be appointed jointly or,
	     in	default	of agreement, to be appointed by the
	     President of the British Computer Society.
